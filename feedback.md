Hi Jarrod,
Great assignment, this was our first foray into layouts so it's going to take a little bit of time to fall into place perfectly.
Try to avoid the use of single letter classes (`c` and `d`) and try to descripe what you are styling at little more, you will thank yourself in future when the project grows!
Really great use of CSS, still a few tricks to learn to get the design to go a full length of the screen, but Flexbox makes that all a lot eaiser.
Looking good, great progress so far.
